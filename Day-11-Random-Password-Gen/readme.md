# Random Password Generator
This Python code generates a random password of a specified length using a combination of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, and digits. The length of the password is specified as an input parameter to the function "generate_password," which generates a random string of characters using the "random" and "string" modules. The "letters" variable is defined as a combination of ASCII letters and digits using the "string.ascii_letters" and "string.digits" constants. The "random.choice" function is used to randomly select characters from the "letters" set to generate a password of the specified length. The password is returned by the function and printed to the console using the "print" function.
