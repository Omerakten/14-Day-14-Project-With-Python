# Desi calculator
This code is a desi calculator that calculates the desi value of an item based on its dimensions. The desi value is a measure of the volume-to-weight ratio of an item, and is commonly used in the shipping industry to determine shipping costs.

The program uses a while loop to repeatedly ask the user for the name and dimensions of an item. It then calculates the desi value of the item using the formula width x length x height / 3000, and rounds the result to the nearest integer.

After displaying the desi value of the item, the program asks the user if they want to rerun the program or exit. If the user chooses to exit, the program displays a "System Shut Down" message and terminates.

Overall, this program is a simple yet useful tool for calculating the desi value of items, and can be especially helpful for businesses and individuals who frequently ship or transport items of various sizes and weights.
