# Body Mass Index Calculator

This code is a Body Mass Index (BMI) calculator that takes user inputs for height and weight, calculates the BMI score, and then categorizes the score based on different thresholds. After prompting the user to input their height and weight, the code calculates the BMI score by dividing weight by the square of height, and then prints the result with a message indicating the user's BMI category. The categories are as follows:

BMI score less than or equal to 18: Thin
BMI score between 18 and 24 (inclusive): Normal
BMI score between 25 and 29 (inclusive): Fat
BMI score between 30 and 34 (inclusive): 1st degree obesity
BMI score between 35 and 39 (inclusive): 2nd degree obesity
BMI score greater than or equal to 40: 3rd degree obesity
The printed results are color-coded using ANSI escape codes to enhance readability.
