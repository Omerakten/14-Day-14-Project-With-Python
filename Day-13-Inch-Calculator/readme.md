# Inch Calculator
This is a Python program that converts lengths between centimeters and inches. It uses a while loop to continuously prompt the user for their choice of conversion until a valid option is entered.

If the user selects 'cm', the program asks for the length in centimeters, calculates the equivalent length in inches, and displays the result to the user. If the user selects 'in', the program asks for the length in inches, calculates the equivalent length in centimeters, and displays the result.

If an invalid option is entered, the program displays an error message and prompts the user to try again.
