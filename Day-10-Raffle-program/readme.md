# Raffle Program
This Python program is designed to conduct a draw. The user is prompted to enter the number of winners they want to choose, and then enter the name of each participant. The program then randomly selects the specified number of winners from the list of participants and displays their names.

The program uses the random module to randomly select the winners. It first prompts the user to enter the number of winners they want to choose, and then uses a for loop to prompt the user to enter the name of each participant. The program then randomly selects the specified number of winners using the random.sample() method and displays their names.

This is a useful program for conducting giveaways, raffles, or other types of random draws.
