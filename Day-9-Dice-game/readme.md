# Dice Game
This Python code is designed to play a dice game. When the program starts, you are given two options: "x" to roll the dice or "q" to quit the game. If you choose "x," the program will roll two dice and display their values along with the sum of their values. If you choose "q," the program will terminate.

The program uses the random module to generate random numbers for the two dice. It then calculates the sum of the two dice and displays the values to the user. If the user chooses "q," the program will terminate. This is a simple game that allows you to test your luck and have fun rolling dice.
