# rock paper scissors game
This Python code is written to play the rock paper scissors game. When you start the game, you are presented with three options to choose from: rock, paper, or scissors. If you press the "Q" key, you exit the game.

If your selection is rock and the computer's selection is scissors, or if your selection is paper and the computer's selection is rock, or if your selection is scissors and the computer's selection is paper, you will see the message "Congratulations, you win!" Otherwise, you will see the message "Sorry, you lose!" In this game, you can try your luck at winning using the rock paper scissors rules.
