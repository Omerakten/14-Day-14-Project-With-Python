# Magic 8 Ball
This program simulates a Magic 8 Ball, a toy used for fortune-telling or seeking advice. The user is prompted to ask a question, and the program randomly selects a response from a list of possible answers. The responses range from positive affirmations to negative predictions or vague answers. The Magic 8 Ball's responses are intended to be playful and not to be taken too seriously, but they can provide an entertaining diversion or spark the user's imagination.
