# Currency exchange rate calculator
This Python code allows the user to select the base currency and the currency to be converted. The user then inputs the exchange rate of the base currency and the amount to be converted. The converted amount is calculated and printed to the screen as the result.

If the converted amount is an integer, the output will be displayed as "Base currency rate {baseCurrencyRate} Convert amount {int(convertAmount)} : Converted amount {int(result)} {baseCurrencyName}". However, if the result is a decimal number, the output will be displayed as "Base currency rate {baseCurrencyRate} Convert amount {convertAmount} : Converted amount {result:.3f} {baseCurrencyName}". This ensures that the converted amount is displayed up to 3 decimal places.

This code can be used for financial calculations, such as understanding prices in another country or performing currency conversion for travel purposes.
