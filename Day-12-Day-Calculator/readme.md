# Day calculator
This Python program calculates the number of days remaining until a target date specified by the user. The program uses the datetime module to get the current date and asks the user to input the year, month, and day of the target date. It then calculates the difference between the two dates in days and prints the result.

The program prompts the user to enter the year, month, and day of the target date using the input() function. It then creates a datetime object representing the target date using the datetime.date() constructor. The difference between the target date and the current date is calculated using the "-" operator, which returns a timedelta object representing the difference in days. The days attribute of the timedelta object is used to extract the number of remaining days, which is printed to the console using the print() function.
